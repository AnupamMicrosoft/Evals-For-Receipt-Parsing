# Eval-Driven System Design: From Prototype to Production

## Overview

### Purpose of This Cookbook

This cookbook provides a **practical**, end-to-end guide on how to effectively use 
evals as the core process in creating a production-grade autonomous system to 
replace a labor-intensive human workflow. It's a direct product of collaborative 
experience dealing with projects where users may not have started with pristine 
labeled data or a perfect understanding of the problem - two issues that most tutorials gloss 
over but are in practice almost always serious challenges.

Making evals the core process prevents poke-and-hope guesswork and impressionistic
judgments of accuracy, instead demanding engineering rigor. This means we can make
principled decisions about cost trade-offs and investment. 

### Target Audience

This guide is designed for ML/AI engineers and Solution Architects who are
looking for practical guidance beyond introductory tutorials. This notebook is fully
executable and organized to be as modular as possible to support using code
samples directly in your own applications.

### Guiding Narrative: From Tiny Seed to Production System

We'll follow a realistic storyline: **replacing a manual receipt-analysis service for validating expenses.**

* **Start Small:** Begin with a very small set of labeled data (retail receipts). Many businesses don't have good ground truth data sets. 
* **Build Incrementally:** Develop a minimal viable system and establish initial evals. 
* **Business Alignment:** Evaluate eval performance in the context of business KPIs and
  dollar impact, and target efforts to avoid working on low-impact improvements.
* **Eval-Driven Iteration:** Iteratively improve by using eval scores to power model
  improvements, then by using better models on more data to expand evals and identify more
  areas for improvement.

### How to Use This Cookbook

This cookbook is structured as an eval-centric guide through the lifecycle of building
an LLM application.

1. If you're primarily interested in the ideas presented, read through the text and skim over
   the code.
2. If you're here because of something else you're working on, you can go ahead and jump to that
   section and dig into the code there, copy it, and adapt it to your needs.
3. If you want to really understand how this all works, download this notebook and run
   the cells as you read through it; edit the code to make your own changes, test your
   hypotheses, and make sure you actually understand how it all works together.
